## <a name="intro">Introduction</a>
Some of the criminal justice community's most vexing problems happen every day in
America. Although there are many methods to help police respond to crime and conduct
investigations more effectively, predicting where and when a crime is likely to occur—and
which type of crimes is likely responsible for prior crimes—has recently gained considerable
currency.
We have all of the data downloaded from The National Institute of Justice's (NIJ) website for
this project. Based on those data, we developed our model to predict the hotspots for street
crime in November 2016.

The algorithms we applied are Linear Regression, self-defined Proportion Algorithm. Both of
them can give a good overall accuracy. Python and QGIS are the tools we use to clean,
prepare, visualize, predict, and analyze our data as well as the result.
The data we downloaded from the [NIJ website](https://nij.gov/funding/Pages/fy16-crime-forecasting-challenge-document.aspx#data) includes eight zipfiles of crime records which
start from March 2012 to October 2016 and one zipfile of Portland district information.
